# Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code to perform statistical analysis on the Iris dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. The analysis focuses on the first feature (Sepal Length) of the dataset.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

## Statistical Analysis

The code performs the following statistical analyses on the Sepal Length feature:

- **Mean:** Calculates the average value of the Sepal Length feature.
- **Trimmed Mean:** Estimates the mean less sensitive to outliers by trimming 10% from both ends.
- **Median:** Determines the middle value of the Sepal Length feature.
- **Mode:** Identifies the most frequent value in the Sepal Length feature.
- **Frequency:** Counts the occurrences of unique values in the Sepal Length feature.
- **Range:** Measures the spread of values in the Sepal Length feature.
- **Variance:** Computes the variance of the Sepal Length feature.
- **Standard Deviation:** Calculates the standard deviation of the Sepal Length feature.
- **Percentile:** Determines the nth percentile of the Sepal Length feature.

## Covariance and Correlation

The code provides covariance and correlation coefficient matrices for the Sepal Length and Sepal Width features. These matrices indicate the level of variation and the degree of linear relationship between the two features.

## Note

The code includes commented-out sections for covariance and correlation analyses for demonstration purposes but are not currently executed. However, feel free to modify and extend the code to explore other features or conduct additional analyses.
